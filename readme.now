This Application Supports Tags (not hashtag)

Tag is a unique feature in ichat it is used to identify contacts. but it doesnt reconogize with your chatting keyboard. If you connect any device. it automatically request you to tag .if you tag the tag is visible only for you. Not the other person.

You can Export chat's in .chat(File Format)  like "iwhatsapp". iF you export a .chat file and import it to an other device , Your device will have  Some M.A.C Adress problems.... | So temporory "ichat" didn't support to export chats..
